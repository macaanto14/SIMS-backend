Security Review Summary
✅ Positive Security Findings:
RLS is properly enabled on all database tables (good security foundation)
No hardcoded credentials found in frontend code
Supabase client properly configured with secure authentication settings
No sensitive data exposure in environment variables or configuration files
Well-structured RLS policies for the existing school management system data
⚠️ Critical Security Issues Found:
1. Missing Core Application Tables (HIGH PRIORITY)
The database schema shows a school management system, but the core ledger application tables are completely missing:

categories table (for account categorization)
accounts table (for customer/supplier accounts)
transactions table (for credit/debit entries)
cashbook_entries table (for business expenses)
payment_reminders table (for payment notifications)
Security Impact: Without proper tables and RLS policies, any future implementation would lack fundamental data protection.

2. Database Function Security Warnings (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
The database linter identified several security concerns:

5 functions lack proper search_path configuration, creating potential SQL injection vulnerabilities
Security definer view detected that could bypass RLS policies
OTP expiry settings exceed recommended security thresholds
Leaked password protection is currently disabled
3. Missing Authentication Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)
The application currently has:

No login/logout functionality implemented
No user registration system
No authentication guards on routes
No profile management for users
Security Impact: Without authentication, anyone can access the application and potentially all data.

4. Incomplete Application Structure (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
The current codebase shows:

Only basic UI components without actual ledger functionality
No input validation or sanitization systems
No API endpoints for data operations
No error handling for security-sensitive operations
Security Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Database Security Foundation
Create missing ledger tables with proper RLS policies:

categories table with user-based access control
accounts table restricting access to user's own accounts
transactions table with user-specific isolation
cashbook_entries table for business expense tracking
payment_reminders table with proper user restrictions
Fix database function security issues:

Add SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = '' to all functions
Remove or secure the security definer view
Configure proper OTP expiry settings
Enable leaked password protection
Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization
Implement user authentication system:

Create login/signup pages with proper validation
Add authentication guards to protect routes
Implement session management with secure token handling
Add user profile management functionality
Add input validation & sanitization:

Implement Zod schemas for all form inputs
Add XSS protection for text inputs
Validate all financial data entries
Sanitize file uploads and attachments
Phase 3: Application Security Hardening
Implement proper error handling:

Add try-catch blocks for all database operations
Implement user-friendly error messages without exposing sensitive info
Add logging for security events and failed authentication attempts
Add data validation layers:

Client-side validation for immediate feedback
Server-side validation in RLS policies
Type checking for all financial calculations
Range validation for monetary amounts
Phase 4: Security Testing & Monitoring
Add security monitoring:

Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
Add rate limiting for API endpoints
Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
Implement backup security:

Add data encryption for sensitive fields
Implement secure backup procedures
Add data retention policies
Ensure GDPR compliance for personal data
This security review reveals that while the database foundation is solid, the core application functionality and security implementation is incomplete. The missing authentication system and ledger-specific tables represent critical security gaps that need immediate attention.
